            <h2>How To Clean</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>For removing odors</strong> — Vacuum the pillow thoroughly, lay it on a flat surface, and generously coat the pillow in baking soda. Let it sit overnight before vacuuming it away.</li>
                <li><strong>For removing stains</strong> — Blot the stain with water, apply boric acid or any alternative stain remover, and keep blotting until the stain has lifted.</li>
                <li><strong>For cleaning regularly</strong> — Soak the pillow in warm water with a light amount of laundry detergent for 10 minutes, gently squeeze out most of the water, run warm water over the pillow to remove excess detergent, and leave it in a well-ventilated area, such as outdoors on a sunny day, to dry.</li>
