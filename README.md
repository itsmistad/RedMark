## Shopify Theme Kit

This branch runs on the [Shopify Theme Kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/).
This branch also requires [bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install) to function, so make sure to have those installed.

It is highly recommended you use this in conjunction with a [Shopify Partners](https://www.shopify.com/partners) store so that you can develop on an environment that is isolated from your live store.

To take full advantage of this theme, use the same plugins as found on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uH1LK3mLPdQDSeOetnEQVv41eN-27GgdUSVzP5lXges/edit?usp=sharing).

### Configuration
In order to connect the kit to your shopify store(s), you need to modify your `config.yml`. An example file (`example.config.yml`) has been provided to show you the structure.

Use your real store for your `prod` credentials and your partner store for your `dev` credentials.

#### Retrieving the Theme ID
> theme get --list -p=(your-password) -s=(your-store.myshopify.com)

This ID is required for your configuration. The password here is the password generated by the private managed app you must create in your store's admin page. To do this, go to your `Apps` view and click the small linked text at the bottom.

### Installation
#### Installing the Shopify Theme Kit
> choco install themekit

Pretty simple.

### Usage

**Be aware that deploying or using live preview will include your `settings_data.json` across environments!**

Before running any bash command, ensure that you are in the root of the repo.
Valid options for `environment`:
- `prod`
- `dev`

#### Start Live Preview
> ./scripts/start.sh `environment`

This will watch and actively deploy any changes to your local source files. The deployment target is the store attached to the specified environment.

#### Deploy to Environment
> ./scripts/deploy.sh `environment`

This will build and deploy your local source files to the appropriate environment. This is *not* necessary when in live preview.

#### Pull from Environment
> ./scripts/get.sh `environment`

This will download your theme from the Shopify cloud and overwrite your local source files.
